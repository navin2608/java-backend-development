two types of data types 
1. primitive - char, int, boolean, short, float, doubt, byte, long
2. non- primitive- classes, interfaces, arrays

three type of variables
1. local- declared inside the method
2. instance- declared inside the class but outside the method 
3. static - delcared as static it cannot be local, we can create a single copy of static variable and share it acrooss classes
